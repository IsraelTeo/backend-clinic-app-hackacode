# Clinic App Backend
<p>This application serves as the backend for a medical clinic and was developed as part of the "Hackacode" hackathon organized by Todocode. It was presented on February 25, 2025, and has since been expanded with new features, significant improvements, refactorings, and updates.
The system is built using the Go programming language and enables CRUD operations for managing patients, doctors, and medical appointments while ensuring proper scheduling based on doctors' availability. Additionally, it features an authorization-based login system.
